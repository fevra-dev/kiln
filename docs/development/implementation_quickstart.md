decodes them, simulates them, and generates a comprehensive report.
```

### Friday: Verification System (6-8 hours)
**Goal**: Independent verification working

```typescript
// Tasks:
1. ✅ Implement multi-RPC verifier
2. ✅ Build public verification UI
3. ✅ Add confidence scoring logic
4. ✅ Test with various teleburn states

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Run First)

```bash
# Test core helpers
pnpm test src/lib/derived-owner.test.ts
pnpm test src/lib/inscription-verifier.test.ts
pnpm test src/lib/memo-builder.test.ts

# Should see:
# ✓ deriveOwner produces deterministic results
# ✓ deriveOwner finds off-curve points
# ✓ verifyInscriptionBytes handles 404s
# ✓ buildSealMemo produces valid JSON
```

### Integration Tests (Run Second)

```bash
# Test API endpoints
pnpm test src/app/api/tx/seal/route.test.ts
pnpm test src/app/api/verify/route.test.ts

# Should see:
# ✓ POST /api/tx/seal builds valid transaction
# ✓ POST /api/verify returns correct status
```

### E2E Tests (Run Last)

```bash
# Test user flows
pnpm test:e2e

# Should see:
# ✓ inscription verification blocks on mismatch
# ✓ dry run completes successfully
# ✓ wizard flow reaches completion
```

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Staging Environment

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel staging
vercel --env staging

# Test on devnet:
# 1. Verify inscription verification works
# 2. Run complete dry run
# 3. Execute testnet teleburn
# 4. Verify status shows correctly
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Final checks:
□ All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
□ TypeScript strict mode clean
□ ESLint zero warnings
□ Coverage >95% on helpers
□ Security audit passed
□ Dry run tested with real NFTs on mainnet
□ Verification tested with real teleburns

# Deploy:
vercel --prod

# Monitor:
# - Watch error rates in Sentry
# - Check RPC rate limits
# - Monitor verification requests
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "Inscription verification times out"
```typescript
// Solution: Increase timeout or add retry
const ORDINALS_CONFIG = {
  CONTENT_TIMEOUT: 60000, // Increase from 30s
  RETRY_ATTEMPTS: 3
};
```

### Issue: "Derived owner is on-curve"
```typescript
// Should never happen, but if it does:
// 1. Check domain string is correct
// 2. Verify bump increments properly
// 3. Ensure using SHA-256, not SHA-512
```

### Issue: "Dry run shows simulation failure"
```typescript
// Debug steps:
// 1. Check if Token-2022 with incompatible extension
// 2. Verify sufficient balance for fees
// 3. Check if metadata is immutable (can't update URI)
// 4. Review simulation logs for specific error
```

### Issue: "Verification shows 'unknown' status"
```typescript
// Likely causes:
// 1. Token still active (not retired yet)
// 2. Custom retirement method (not KILN compliant)
// 3. RPC out of sync
// Solution: Check multiple RPCs, search transaction history
```
